# Architectures and activations functions


## Architectures

Although the user is free to construct their neural estimator however they see fit, `NeuralEstimators` provides several useful architectures described below.

```@docs
DeepSet

GNN

PropagateReadout
```


## Activation functions

These layers can be used at the end of an architecture to ensure that the
neural estimator provides valid parameters.

```@docs
Compress

CholeskyCovariance

CovarianceMatrix

CorrelationMatrix

SplitApply
